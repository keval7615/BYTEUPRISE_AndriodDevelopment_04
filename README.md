TIC TAC TOE 


Develop a Tic Tac Toe game app where two players can take turns to place their symbols (X or O) on a 3x3 grid.

The objective is to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three of their symbols to win the game. 

The app should also include a reset option to start a new game
